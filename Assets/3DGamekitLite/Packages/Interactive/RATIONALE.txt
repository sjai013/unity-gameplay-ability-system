UnityEvent is built-in, and is a common user experience.

It uses reflection, which at best is 11x slower than a native call. This is
acceptable for connecting GUI events to functionality, but is not suitable
for use inside inner game loops. Worst case is almost 40x slower.

The interaction system is higher level than the UnityEvent system, and
requires less input from the game designer to create functionality. It does
not use reflection.
